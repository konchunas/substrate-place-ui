# Substrate Place UI

This project is a user interface for [Substrate Place](http://github.com/konchunas/substrate-place) runtime module.

It is a web page connecting to the node and retreiving pixel board from blockchain. As user scrolls the map it automatically fetches new chunks of pixels and plots them on the screen. It has functionality for selecting and purchasing the pixel as well as basic wallet functionality. As of now faucet is already included into interface so you can jumpstart and try this application online right now by following the link.
